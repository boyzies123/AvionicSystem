The schedule is that each member should contribute 6-7 hours a week. If hours needs to be redistributed, this should be discussed in the discord server. Currently the aim is:

Week 8: Planning phase. This involves creating plans for software requirements, verification, configuration management, and quality assurance.

Week 9: Analysis/Design phase. Document the requirements, undertake hazard analysis, and document design which should be traceable back to requirements.

Week 10: Development phase. Integrating design through code.

Half of week 11: Integration phase. Integrate the individual software components. 

Half of week 11 to half of week 12: Testing including unit tests, integration tests and system level tests.

For the tasks in planning phase, all members should write their own requirements and the requirements should be compared to form the final requirement documentation. Same with the artifacts.
Coding and testing tasks will be distributed between all members based on preference. 

Every week we should aim to have two meetings. One on discord and one in-person. On discord should be Monday and in person should be on Fridays at 1pm to 2pm. 
The outcomes of the meeting should be documented in a markdown file by one person. This where delays on the tasks should be reported and should be posted on discord, as well as the issue tracking.
Gitlab will be used as a repository for code and documentation and the issue tracking system will be used when needed. Java will be the language used for coding.
