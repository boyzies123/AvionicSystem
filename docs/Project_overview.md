# Project Overview

## Avionics Flight Management and Control System

This project requires us to make a avionic system that will manage flight plans and make corrections while monitoring systems and providing a pilot a UI and control management.

### Managing flight plans

The system must track current flight plans and display the corresponding information to the pilots UI.
This information includes things like location, speed, trajectory, etc.

### Making corrections

The system, while in autopilot, will adjust its speed and trajectory accordingly to the destination and waypoints.This can be manually overrided by the pilot to make adjustments in case of emergancy or fault in system.

### Data Display

The system must display information to the pilot:
- airspeed
- altitude
- pitch
- roll
- yaw
- engine peramiters

As we as indecators for data updating and hazard warnings:
- blinking lights
- sound signals
- checklist or prosedure for incedents
