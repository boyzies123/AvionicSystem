# Project Overview

## Avionics Flight Management and Control System

This system will manage flight plans and make corrections while monitoring systems and providing a pilot UI.

### Managing flight plans
The system must track current flight plans and display the corresponding information to the pilots UI.
This information includes things like location, speed, trajectory, etc.

### Making corrections
The system, while in autopilot, will adjust its speed and trajectory accordingly to the destination and waypoints.
